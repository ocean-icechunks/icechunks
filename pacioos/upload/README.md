# Copying PacIOOS model files to Source Cooperative

These scripts copy PacIOOS's model output, the original NetCDF files unchanged, from the server
that holds them to the `ocean-icechunks/pacioos` product on
[Source Cooperative](https://source.coop/ocean-icechunks/pacioos). Icechunk stores are then
built over the copies, so readers use Source Cooperative instead of the PacIOOS server.

| File | What it is for | Where it runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `upload_to_source_coop.sh` | the upload | on the server that holds the files |
| `verify_source_coop_copy.py` | checks the copies, byte for byte | anywhere; it needs no login |
| `upload_over_ssh.sh` | runs the upload from another machine, over a read-only SSH login | that other machine |

## Products

| Product | Folder on the PacIOOS server | On Source Cooperative | Files | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `roms_hiig` | `/export/data/model/ocn/roms_forecast/hiig` | `pacioos/roms_hiig/` | 651 | 1.24 TB |
| `wrf_hi` | `/export/data/model/atm/wrf_hi` | `pacioos/wrf_hi/` | 5,605 | 0.93 TB |
| `ww3_hawaii` | `/export/data/model/ore/ww3/hawaii` | `pacioos/ww3_hawaii/` | 5,231 | 0.49 TB |

Counts as of 2026-11-10. Each folder holds one subfolder per year, and the same layout is kept on
Source Cooperative: for example, `.../hiig/2026/hiig_forec_20261109.nc` becomes
`pacioos/roms_hiig/2026/hiig_forec_20261109.nc`. To add another product, add a line to
`SOURCE_DIR` near the top of `upload_to_source_coop.sh`, or name it on the command line as
`name=/folder`.

## Running the upload on the PacIOOS server

1. **Get `rclone`.** It is one program file, and needs no installation or root. Download the
   Linux zip from <https://rclone.org/downloads/>, check it against the published `SHA256SUMS`,
   and unzip it anywhere you like.
2. **Get Source Cooperative upload keys.** You need an account that can write to the
   `ocean-icechunks/pacioos` product, and the
   [`source-coop` CLI](https://github.com/source-cooperative/source-coop-cli). Then either:
   - `eval "$(source-coop creds --format env)"`, which gives keys for about 12 hours, or
   - set up the AWS profile described at the top of `upload_to_source_coop.sh`. It gets fresh
     keys by itself, which is better for long runs.
3. **See what it would do,** without uploading anything:
   ```bash
   RCLONE=/path/to/rclone ./upload_to_source_coop.sh --dry-run roms_hiig
   ```
4. **Run it,** saving the output:
   ```bash
   RCLONE=/path/to/rclone ./upload_to_source_coop.sh roms_hiig wrf_hi ww3_hawaii 2>&1 | tee -a upload.log
   ```

**What it does for each file:**
- **Skips** the file if it is already on Source Cooperative, or if it changed in the last 2 hours
  (it may still be being written).
- **Computes its MD5 checksum, then uploads it.** Both steps run at the lowest CPU and disk
  priority, so the server's own work comes first.
- **Checks the uploaded size, then uploads a small `<file>.md5`** next to it. A `.md5` file
  means that file's upload finished.

You can stop the script at any time (Ctrl+C) and run it again: it carries on where it left off.
For the same reason, running it once a day after the model runs finish uploads just the new
files.

**Load on the server.** In a test on 2026-11-11, two files at a time (`PARALLEL=2`, the default)
used about 20% of one CPU core and 170 MB of memory, and added about 30–50 MB/s of outgoing
network traffic. Each file is read from disk once. To lighten the load, use `PARALLEL=1`; to
stop, press Ctrl+C.

## Checking the copies

```bash
python3 verify_source_coop_copy.py pacioos/roms_hiig/                 # every file
python3 verify_source_coop_copy.py pacioos/roms_hiig/ --sample 20     # a random 20
python3 verify_source_coop_copy.py pacioos/ --list-only               # what's there, no downloads
```

It downloads each file over public HTTPS, computes its MD5, and compares it with the `.md5`
file. Run it on a machine other than the PacIOOS server, since the downloads use that
machine's network.

## Running it from another machine (`upload_over_ssh.sh`)

This is how the first copy was made (Nov 2026), by someone with a read-only login on the PacIOOS
server. The upload script and short-lived keys are sent over SSH for each run, and nothing is
saved on the server except the `rclone` program the run uses. Runs are sized to end before the
keys expire, and the next run starts with fresh keys. The logs are kept on the machine running
it. Setup and settings are described at the top of the script.

## Things about Source Cooperative that `rclone` needs told

Each of these was found by testing in November 2026. All are set in
`upload_to_source_coop.sh`, so there's nothing to do; this list explains why those lines are
there.

| Setting | Without it |
| --- | --- |
| `sign_accept_encoding = false` | every request fails with `SignatureDoesNotMatch` |
| `list_version = 2` | listings say "directory not found" |
| `no_check_bucket = true` | uploads fail with `Missing object key` |
| `upload_cutoff = 0`, streaming cutoff 0 | uploads sent in one piece fail with "headers present in the request which were not signed" |
| `chunk_size = 64M` | requests over about 100 MB are refused (`413`) |

Source Cooperative also drops the checksum `rclone` normally stores with a file. That is why
the scripts keep the `.md5` files instead.

Speeds also depend on distance. From the PacIOOS server, uploads to Source Cooperative go
through Cloudflare in Honolulu, at about 20 MB/s per file. A copy pulled over SSH to a
mainland machine got under 1 MB/s.
